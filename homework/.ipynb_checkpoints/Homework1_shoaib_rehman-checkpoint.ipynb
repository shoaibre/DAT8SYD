    "## Homework:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setup\n",
    "* Resolve any installation issues before next class.\n",
    "* Make sure you have a github profile and created a repo called \"SYD_DAT_8\"\n",
    "* Clone the class repo (this one!)\n",
    "* Review this [code](../labs/Week 1/00_python_refresher.py) for a recap of some Python basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Communication\n",
    "* Read [Analyzing the Analyzers](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920029014/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf) for a useful look at the different types of data scientists. Write down 5 key points you took away from the article\n",
    "* Read about some [Markdown Techniques](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)\n",
    "* Write a summary of 2 chapters of [The Data Science Handbook](http://www.thedatasciencehandbook.com/) in Markdown in this notebook and commit it to your repository on github\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Programming\n",
    "* Complete the lab from class and the additional Exercise below\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Course Project\n",
    "* Come up with 5 different ideas for your course project. For each one list:\n",
    "  * Overview of your idea\n",
    "  * What data you will use\n",
    "  * What the outcome is that you are trying to achieve\n",
    "  * Any ideas of modelling techniques it may involve\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions: copy this file and append your name in the filename, e.g. Homework1_ian_hansel.ipynb.\n",
    "Then commit this in your local repository, push it to your github account so I can see your work. Remeber if you get stuck to look at the slides going over Git**"

    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analyzing the Analyzers\n",
    "* Authors identified four categories of Data Scientists. Data Business People, Data developers, Data Creatives and Data Researchers.\n",
    "* Data Business People are mostly leaders and likely to have managed people. They definitely have technical skills and likely to have an undergraduate degree.Data Creatives can apply wide range of tools to solve a problem from extracting data to creating a visulaization. They have more likely done consulting work and too part in hackathon. Data Developers are people focussed on solving technical problem. They are least likely to have taken a consulting job.Data Researcher have done undertaken academic reserach projects.They are least likely to have started a business.\n",
    "* Successful data scientisits need to have experise in at least one aspect of data science that matches 'T-shape' with T representing breadth of skills and vertical bar represents breadth in one area.\n",
    "* A data scientist must have full support from management, access to decision makers and raw data. The outcome must be translated into change.It is important to have a team instead of expecting outcome from an individual.\n",
    "* Data Scientist can be rotated with in organisaton so that they can increase breadth of their skills \n",
    "## CLARE CORTHELL\n",
    "* Acquire skills that job description requires by designing and executing your own project. Demonstrate that you have skills required to do that job. Help roganizations that dont have power to do their own data mining.\n",
    "* Look for companies that would recognize your potential instead of looking for pattern in your previous experience.\n",
    "* Quora,blogs and coursera are amazing resources to acquire skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## GEORGE ROUMELIOTIS\n",
    "* A Data Scientist possess skills in advanced statistics,machine learning, SQL and Hadoop, and programming language such as Java\n",
    "* Data scientist need to have business consulting skills.Data Scientist is some one who can not only reposnd to data requests but can also influence decision making\n",
    "* In order to acquire technical skills, it is important to learn SQL,noSQL and Hadoop. HBR can be a good platform to learn about business.\n",
    "* In order to become a successful data scientist, build connection with colleagues. Influence others by gaining their trust. Take ownership for process how business works\n",
    "* Most data science are aimed at improving business process and business process involves people, systems  and steps. Empthy is important \n",
    "* Some data scientist will need to become product designers due to products that will be possible by Data Science"

Depending upon past sales, which products can be pushed and can be orderd to avoid stockouts.Shelf space is a luxury when it comes to a profitable retail operation not only in stock room but also sales floor.\n"
